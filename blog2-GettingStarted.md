#Blog 2. Getting Started

After our January exams we had about a week free before the next semester. We decided to spend a bit of time revising and preparing to make our project.

####Learning

We weren't sure how the actual code of our app would be structured, so we had a look into a number of different android app architectures. We learned about the Model-View-Presenter architecture and decided something like this would be most appropriate for our app as it is focused on manipulating and viewing data in a database.

We also revised some Java design patterns as they would come in useful when coding an object oriented app. Knowing about the more commonly used design patterns would help when explaining ideas to each other.

Due to exams, it had been a few weeks since we last used android studio. It was important to look over examples and refamiliarise ourselves with what we already knew.

####Prototyping

We had made quick UI mock ups in the past but these didn't accurately convey the flow of events when using the app. To do this we needed to make a prototype. We made a basic prototype using the tools on a website called [Proto.io](www.proto.io)

We hope this prototype will be useful throughout development. When we want to add a discussed feature, we can add it to the prototype to show each other how it will work and then can go about coding it.

####Conclusion
 
With our upcoming three week module at the start of semester 2 this prep work would be invaluable in speeding up the process of getting started.
